## About the Gem 
<p>This gem is a monitoring tool that monitors cpu and memory usage. The gem is based off of a tutorial that I decided to package as a gem. The gem heavily depends on the <a href="https://github.com/plashchynski/crono">crono gem</a> to handle background process, and <a href="https://github.com/ankane/chartkick">chartkick gem</a> for the monitoring charts. You don't have to install chartkick or crono as the uzebba gem will handle the installation.</p>

<p><strong><u>For Windows</u>: </strong> when you start the rails server, the gem will open a new cmd minimized on the taskbar. When you stop the rails server the application will also close the minimized cmd. This is the gem's way of imitating a Linux background process to handle the crono process.</p>

<p><strong><u>For Linux</u>: </strong> when you start the rails server, the crono process will run in background; and when you stop the rails server, the crono process should stop. [<strike>To stop the process via the terminal, you have to do <code>ps aux | grep crono</code> to view the crono pid, and <code>kill -s sigterm [pid]</code> to terminate the process.</strike>]</p>

<p><strong>Do not use in production.</strong></p>
